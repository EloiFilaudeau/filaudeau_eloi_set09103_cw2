# MAO Web app - midi integration (filaudeau_eloi_set09103_cw2)
http://eloifilaudeau.pythonanywhere.com/sampler/ \n
Web application developped in *html, css, javascript* and *python* thanks to the framework *Flask*.
The main part of the app is to allow the use of a midi keyboard or simply the computer keyboard to produce sound thanks to oscillator's functions and make MAO with a simple but functionnal drumpad and keyboard station.
