A web application developped in <code>html, css, javascript</code> and <code>python</code> thanks to the framework <code>Flask</code>.

The main part of the app is to allow the use of a *midi* keyboard or simply the computer keyboard to produce sound thanks to *oscillator's functions* and make **MAO** with a simple but functionnal drumpad and keyboard station.
